# Image segmentation for a robotic arm
This project treats about the study and a comparison between algorithms of image segmentation applied to a robotic arm. This arm is guided by a RGB-camera
and the focus is on the camera. Since the study is for a robotic arm in the case of detecting simple objects used daily the selection of algorithms is based on :
- Real-time analysis
- Accuracy of detection
- Speed of detection
- Capacity to detect objects with different points of view
